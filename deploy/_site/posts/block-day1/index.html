    <h1 class='postTitle'>I have 45 days to find an exploit...</h1>
    
    
    <h2>Where to start?</h2>
<p>My high school have takes the move to ban <em>any</em> sites that are not Microsoft or Google. This is going to screw over loads of students, in almost every subject.
I know for a fact we use loads of non-google and MS sites in Creative Media Production.</p>
<h2>Why 45 days?</h2>
<p>The changes are rolling out on the 1st of Febuary of 2026, and it's currently the 17th of December, 2025. That's 45 days.</p>
<h2>What will happen if you can't find an exploit or loophole?</h2>
<p>I will lose access to loads of work stored on Overleaf, Zoho, and loads of other services. And my friends and other students will be cooked.
I won't stop trying, even if I miss the deadline.</p>
<h2>How can I help?</h2>
<p>If you know anyway to exploit Chromebooks, ping me an email at &quot;meowcat@meowcat.site&quot;, and I'll respond within 24 hours.</p>
<hr>
<p>I will be giving daily updates on this site, so stay posted!</p>
