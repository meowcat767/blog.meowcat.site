Shinitagari is the exploit I am working on to fix the issue addressed in "I have 45 days to find an exploit...". 
It works by executing code in devtools. Code that can break tools like senso.cloud and GoGuardian. 

## How do I get a copy?
Sorry, but it is only going to be distrobuted on **physical media**. This is to try to prevent the spyware companies from patching the holes in their code Shinitagari uses.

## When will it be ready?

As of when this post has been written, 41 days remain to finish the exploit(s), test and distrobute.
