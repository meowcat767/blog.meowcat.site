## Where to start?
My high school have takes the move to ban *any* sites that are not Microsoft or Google. This is going to screw over loads of students, in almost every subject.
I know for a fact we use loads of non-google and MS sites in Creative Media Production. 

## Why 45 days?
The changes are rolling out on the 1st of Febuary of 2026, and it's currently the 17th of December, 2025. That's 45 days.

## What will happen if you can't find an exploit or loophole?
I will lose access to loads of work stored on Overleaf, Zoho, and loads of other services. And my friends and other students will be cooked.
I won't stop trying, even if I miss the deadline. 

## How can I help?
If you know anyway to exploit Chromebooks, ping me an email at "meowcat@meowcat.site", and I'll respond within 24 hours.
